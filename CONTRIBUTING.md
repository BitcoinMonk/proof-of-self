# Contributing to Proof-of-Monk

**Status**: 🚧 Not accepting contributions yet - still in early development!

Once we have a working MVP (Phase 1), we'll open this up for community contributions.

## What We'll Need Later

- **Data Source Adapters**: New ways to import data (email, chat logs, documents)
- **Search Improvements**: Better ranking, semantic search, fuzzy matching
- **UI Development**: Optional web interface for browsing data
- **Documentation**: Setup guides, tutorials, examples
- **Testing**: Test coverage, edge cases, real-world usage
- **Performance**: Optimization for large datasets

## Development Philosophy

When we open for contributions, these will be our principles:

1. **Privacy First**: Never compromise user data privacy
2. **Local First**: Everything should work without internet
3. **Simple**: Easy to understand, easy to extend
4. **Tested**: New features need tests
5. **Documented**: Code should be well-commented

## How to Prepare

If you want to contribute later:
1. ⭐ Star the repo to stay updated
2. 👀 Watch for issues labeled "good first issue"
3. 💬 Join discussions when we set them up
4. 📖 Read the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) to understand the vision

## Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other. This is a tool to empower individuals with their own data and AI. Let's keep it positive, helpful, and focused on that mission.
